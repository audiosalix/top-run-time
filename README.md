# top-run-time
Takes output from RedLime's SpeedRunIGT mod (igt_timer.log) to get the top run retime as per the rules in speedrun.com/mc as well as generating a new file which is a copy of igt_timer.log which specifies what type of pause each one was.

if you'd like to run the .py directly, you'll need to install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and then the best way to install the easygui dependency is to install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) and running 
> pip install easygui

If you're on windows, you can run this via the commands

> python -m pip install easygui

Depending on the setup you may need to replace 'python' with 'python3'.

The other dependencies are included by installing python.
